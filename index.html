        <h2 class="color-red">Today we will be talking about african cuisine</h2>
        <h3 class="color-red">Nigerian Jellof rice, Piri Piri chicken and Bunny Chow</h3>
        <P>It’s not easy pinning down a national favorite dish for Nigeria, because this is a vast country with many distinct regional cuisines.

            But one dish you shouldn’t leave Nigeria without eating is jollof rice, a great favorite all over West Africa, and one that is thought may be the origin of the Cajun dish jambalaya.
            
            A simple, spicy one-pot dish comprising, at its most basic, rice, tomatoes, onions and pepper, it’s often served at parties and other festive gatherings, along with other Nigerian favorites such as egusi soup (made with ground melon seeds and bitter leaf), fried plantains and pounded yam (iyan or fufu).
            
            Other dishes to try in Nigeria include thick, spicy broths made with okra and flavored with chicken or meat, and suya, which are spicy Nigerian shish kebabs (similar to Ghana’s chichinga) cooked over braziers by street vendors.
            
            Where to taste it: For authentic jollof rice, egusi soup and other traditional dishes, locals recommend Yellow Chili, 27 Oju Olobun Close, off Bishop Oluwole Street, Lagos. Tel: +234 809 962 3614. For excellent suya, the place to go is University of Suya, Allen Avenue, Ikeja, Lagos.</P>
            <p>Mozambique’s cuisine is a heady blend of African, Portuguese, oriental and Arab flavors – think fragrant spices, hot piri piri and creamy coconut sauces, with hints of cashews and peanuts.

                Sizzling, spicy prawns and seafood are often a first choice for visitors to Maputo, but don’t miss the iconic Mozambican dish Galinha à Zambeziana, a succulent feast of chicken cooked with lime, pepper, garlic, coconut milk and piri piri sauce.
                
                It’s generally known simply as grilled chicken piri piri by tourists, and is traditionally served with matapa, a dish of cassava leaves cooked in a peanut sauce.
                
                Where to taste it: Head downtown to the aptly named Piri Piri, an unpretentious eatery with a charming atmosphere and an interesting crowd. Avenida 24 de Julho, Maputo
                
                3. Jollof rice and egusi soup, Nigeria</p>
                <p>No one’s quite sure how bunny chow came to be named, but what is certain is that this hollowed-out half- or quarter-loaf of white bread filled with a blistering-hot curry is one of South Africa’s most treasured street foods.

                    The meat and vegetable curries that fill bunny chows were bought to South Africa by Indian indentured laborers who came to South Africa in the 19th century to work on the sugar-cane fields.
                    
                    Available as takeaways in all major cities, but the best bunnies come from Durban.
                    
                    Where to taste it: Durbanites agree that the finest bunnies are to be found at the Britannia Hotel, 1299 Umgeni Road, Durban. Tel: +27 31 303 2266; and Gounden’s Restaurant, 39 Eaton Road, Umbilo, Durban. Tel: +27 31 205 5363
